1. The Abstract Factory pattern provides a way to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
2. The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. It's particularly useful when you need to create an object with numerous possible configurations.
**Builder Pattern = Configure first, build later**
3. The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
4. The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by cloning an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is particularly useful when creating an object is more expensive than copying an existing one.
