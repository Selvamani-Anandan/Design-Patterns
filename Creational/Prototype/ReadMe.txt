# Prototype Pattern

## What is the Prototype Pattern?
The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by cloning an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is particularly useful when creating an object is more expensive than copying an existing one.

## Easy Way to Remember
Think of a Photocopy Machine:
- You have an original document (prototype)
- Instead of rewriting the document, you make a copy (clone)
- The copy has the same content but is a separate object
- You can modify the copy without affecting the original

## Real-World Analogy
Consider a biological cell division:
- A cell (prototype) creates an exact copy of itself
- The new cell (clone) has the same DNA but is independent
- The new cell can develop differently from the original

## When to Use
1. When a system needs to create new objects of various classes that share some base properties
2. When the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than cloning
3. When you need to keep the number of classes minimal while allowing customization
4. When objects need to be created at runtime

## Key Components
1. Prototype (IDocument): Declares the cloning interface
2. Concrete Prototypes (TextDocument, SpreadsheetDocument): Implements the cloning operation
3. Client: Creates new objects by asking the prototype to clone itself
4. Registry (DocumentRegistry): Optional component that stores available prototypes

## Benefits
1. Reduces subclassing by letting you clone existing objects
2. Hides complexity of object creation
3. Provides flexibility in creating objects
4. Reduces repeated initialization code

## Example Usage
```csharp
var registry = new DocumentRegistry();
registry.RegisterDocument("text", originalTextDoc);

// Clone a document
var clonedDoc = registry.CreateClone("text");
```

## Implementation Tips
1. Create a common interface with a Clone() method
2. Implement deep copy when needed
3. Consider using a registry to manage prototypes
4. Initialize the clone with the prototype's state
5. Modify the clone as needed

Remember: "Don't create from scratch, clone the prototype!"
